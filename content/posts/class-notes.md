In the past few years of my undergraduate studies, I've accumulated some class notes I typed with LaTeX and Typst. My friends said they were helpful, so I've decided to share some of these notes here for anyone who might find them useful.

<!-- more -->

The early notes were written with LaTeX, while the later ones are in Typst (not until the last semester of my undergrad was I able to write notes in Typst full-speed during class, so there were only three of them in Typst). You can see the change in style and format over time. Typst was not mature at the beginning and lots of the stuff I was familiar with in LaTeX did not exist back then (package management, out-of-box theorems etc., templates to write books). This was both an upside and downside for me because you see, Typst aims to be a modern alternative to LaTeX, and that means it comes with lots of easy-to-use utilities that you can use to build your own building blocks. One thing I found really helpful is the ease of color support and boxes. They allow me to build a more colorful, modern and cleaner look, which I prefer. I had to build theorem boxes and book titling styles from scratch in Typst. It does take some time, but I think it's worth it (I think it looks good and I hope you'd agree \:D)

I didn't put the source code for the notes up, but if you're interested in seeing how I built the components, you can check out my [Typst common repo](https://github.com/George-Miao/typst-common).
